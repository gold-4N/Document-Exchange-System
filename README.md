# Secure Exchange Gateway (SEG) Prototype

## Project Overview

This prototype demonstrates a secure method for exchanging sensitive XML documents between two government departments (Ministry 1 and Ministry 2) through their respective Secure Exchange Gateways (SEGs). The main goal is to ensure:

* **Mutual authentication** using mTLS
* **Data confidentiality and integrity**
* **Origin verification** via digital signatures

It simulates:

* `SEG-Sender`: Responsible for signing and sending an XML document.
* `SEG-Receiver`: Validates sender identity, verifies the signature, and saves the document.

---

## Features

* üîê Mutual TLS (mTLS) for transport security
* ‚úçÔ∏è RSA-SHA256 Digital Signature for document integrity
* üìÑ Signed XML document transmission
* üîç Server-side signature verification
* üíæ File-based document submission and reception

---

## System Architecture

1. `SEG-Sender` signs an XML document using its private key.
2. `SEG-Sender` sends the document and its signature to `SEG-Receiver` via HTTPS using mTLS.
3. `SEG-Receiver` verifies the sender's certificate.
4. `SEG-Receiver` validates the signature using the sender's public key.
5. If verified, the XML is saved securely.

* **Requests** (Sender HTTP client)
* **OpenSSL** for certificate generation
* **Cryptography** Python library for RSA operations

## Directory Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ certs/                  # All TLS and signing certificates
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sample_document.xml     # Input XML document
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sender.py           # Client application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ receiver.py         # Server application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ key_generate.py       # Python script to generate certificates
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

---

## Certificate Setup

Use the following shell script to generate required certificates:

```bash
python key_generate.py
```

This creates:

* Root CA (self-signed)
* SEG-Sender cert signed by Root CA
* SEG-Receiver cert signed by Root CA

---

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install cryptography flask requests
```

### 2. Run SEG Receiver

```bash
python receiver.py
```

Starts an HTTPS server with certificate validation.

### 3. Run SEG Sender

```bash
python sender.py
```

Signs and sends the `sample_document.xml` file.

---

## XML Format (Input)

```xml
<CriticalDocument id="doc123">
  <SenderID>MINISTRY 1_SEG01</SenderID>
  <ReceiverID>MINISTRY 2_SEG01</ReceiverID>
  <TimestampForSignature>YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ</TimestampForSignature>
  <Payload>
    <SensitiveData>Lunch party at Saturday</SensitiveData>
    <Instructions>Deliver by 0300.</Instructions>
  </Payload>
</CriticalDocument>
```

---

## Output (on receiver)

* `received_document.xml`: Saved XML file
* Console log: Signature status (valid/invalid)

---

## Error Handling

* ‚ùå Invalid Signature: Rejected
* ‚ùå Unverified certificate: TLS fails
* ‚úÖ Valid Signature + Authenticated Sender: Document accepted

## Security Summary

| Feature               | Method                            |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Mutual Authentication | TLS with client cert verification |
| Document Integrity    | RSA-SHA256 Digital Signature      |
| Confidentiality       | HTTPS (TLS encryption)            |
| Authentication        | mTLS + signature                  |

---

## Future Improvements

* Add XML Digital Signature standard (XMLDSig)
* Add logging and auditing
* Add UI for managing keys and monitoring transactions
